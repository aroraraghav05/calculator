# calculator
A simple C program that simulates a calculator for basic shapes (Circle, Rectangle, Triangle) using a menu-driven interface. Includes area, perimeter, and circumference calculations with input validation and modular functions.

This C program allows users to calculate the **area** and **perimeter/circumference** of basic geometric shapes:

- Circle
- Rectangle
- Triangle

It uses functions for modularity, includes input validation, and supports user interaction through a simple menu system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Compilation Instructions

To compile the program, you need a C compiler (like GCC). Run the following command:

```bash
gcc shape_calculator.c -o shape_calculator -lm
